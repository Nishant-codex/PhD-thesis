Yvonne Willemsen was born in Wageningen on December 6th, 1992. She obtained her Bachelor's degree of Nutrition and Dietetics, at the Hogeschool Arnhem en Nijmegen in Nijmegen, minoring in infant and child nutrition. To understand the science behind what was taught during her Bachelor's studies, she continued studying Nutrition and Health at Wageningen University \& Research, where she completed two specializations: Molecular Nutrition \& Toxicology and Nutritional Physiology \& Health Status. For both these specializations, her theses focused on toddler, and child nutrition. Within this Master's track, she also did her internship at TNO where she wrote a review on gut microbiota, antibiotics use in early life, and its relations with obesity development. All these previous experiences contributed to her growing interest in the interactions between gut microbiota, nutrition, and health. She was granted an ideal fitting PhD position at the Radboud University (RU) and the Radboudumc (RUMC) in Nijmegen. Under the supervision of Prof. dr. Carolina de Weerth (RUMC), Dr. Roseriet Beijers (RU) and Dr. Alejandro Arias Vásquez (RUMC), she conducted research on (early life) nutrition, gut microbiota, and behaviour as described in this thesis.
